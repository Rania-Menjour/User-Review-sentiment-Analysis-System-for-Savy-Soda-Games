**Mobile Application Performance Optimization**

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to automate solutions that improve user experience and optimize mobile application performance.

**Key Features**

ETL Processes: Implementing robust Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to extract, clean, and structure user reviews. This enhances the efficiency and accuracy of sentiment analysis.

NLP Model Implementation: Fine-tuning a transformer-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) model using Hugging Face Transformers. This includes:

BERT for sentiment analysis

GPT-2 for text summarization

**Machine Learning Architectures:**

Designing and deploying machine learning architectures for large-scale user data analysis. This involves optimizing models with:

Dimensionality reduction

Regularization

Hyperparameter tuning to enhance production efficiency

Cloud-Based AI Deployment: Exploring cloud-based AI deployment strategies and leveraging Docker for containerized model serving.

**Experiment Tracking:**

Integrating MLflow for experiment tracking and model lifecycle management.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Deploying and monitoring models in production using GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines to ensure continuous performance and scalability.

**Conclusion**

This project aims to leverage advanced machine learning techniques and cloud-based solutions to enhance the user experience of mobile applications while ensuring optimal performance.
